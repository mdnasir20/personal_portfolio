        <h2>Personal portfolio A5</h2>
        <p class="pera">I have learned a lot about the designer job. There are so many different types of designing opportunities for instance product designer, UX/UI designer, marketing designer, 3d designer, motion designer. I only knew about UX/UI designer opportunities for the digital service sector. The main important thing I have learned about improving soft skills and adding those skills to our CV. I was mostly focusing on learning only hard skills and ignoring other ones.
