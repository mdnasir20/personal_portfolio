    <section id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="pera">I'm interested in technology, design, and user experience. I concentrated on developing a well-rounded skill set throughout my education, combining design and coding, so that I could make digital solutions that are both practical and easy to use. My passion is designing products that combine usefulness and aesthetics to increase customer happiness and engagement. I like working on projects that force me to use both my technical and creative thinking, such as creating web applications and digital service prototypes.<br><br>

I enjoy keeping up with the newest developments in technology and design in addition to my scholarly pursuits. My objective is to use the potential of digital innovation to support initiatives that improve people's lives.<br><br>

I have completed the Orientation of Digital Services course. <br><br>

While I dived deep into advancing my skills in digital services and design, I found a few challenges on my path. The primary obstacle is the evolution of new technologies. The new tools, frameworks and methodologies require continuous learning and adaptation, which can be time-consuming. Balancing this ongoing learning with academic commitments can be challenging. Another obstacle is the complexity of integrating user-centered design with cutting-edge technologies.<br><br>

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work in teams, exchange ideas, and learn from others.
