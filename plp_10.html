1. Design based on users:<br>
Design based on users, often known as user-centered design (UCD), prioritizes users' demands, preferences, and behaviors throughout the design process. To ensure usability and satisfaction, it is necessary to conduct research on the target audience, create prototypes, and iterate designs in response to feedback. The reason for this strategy is that it allows for the creation of more effective, efficient, and engaging goods and services that are directly matched to real-world user experiences. In the future, using UCD will improve the relevance and effectiveness of design initiatives by aligning them with genuine user expectations and encouraging innovation driven by real-world requirements.<br>

2. Service mapping:<br>
Digital service mapping is a strategic way to visualize and analyze the numerous components and interactions in a digital service environment. By understanding the flow of services from inception to delivery, companies may discover inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and improve customer experiences. Businesses may justify technological investments and identify prospects for innovation by mapping out their offerings. In the future, service mapping can help drive decision-making processes, inform service design, and stimulate team cooperation, resulting in more streamlined operations and more customer satisfaction.<br>

3. Service Design:<br>
Service design is a user-based method of developing or building new services that provide users with smooth, meaningful experiences. It designs thinking, systems thinking, and user experience design to ensure that services are efficient, effective, and user-friendly. Personas, customer journey mapping, service blueprinting, and prototyping are important tools for designers because they help them understand user demands, depict service processes, and test first solutions. The process promotes cooperation and co-creation, including stakeholders and users at each level to ensure that services are developed with real-world demands and pain points in mind. Future projects can employ service design to ensure user-centered and efficient service experiences in healthcare, hotels, and digital services.<br>

4. Prototyping:<br>
Prototyping is an important step in product development because it allows designers and engineers to build an actual or visual representation of a concept before final production. It allows us to test functionality, discover potential issues, and gather input from stakeholders or consumers. Iterating on prototypes allows to modify the design, improve user experience, and guarantee that the final product fulfills the intended goals. Prototyping may advance the invention process, save expenses associated with late-stage adjustments, and stimulate innovation by allowing for early experimentation with various ideas.<br>

5. Testing:<br>
Testing for digital service design is crucial for ensuring user satisfaction and functionality. It involves employing various methods, such as user testing and usability studies, to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement. Justifying the need for rigorous testing stems from the potential risks of launching a service that does not meet user needs, which can lead to wasted resources and diminished brand reputation. For future endeavors, integrating a robust testing framework early in the design process will enable iterative improvements, foster user engagement, and ensure the final product aligns closely with user expectations, ultimately driving success in the digital landscape.<br>

In my peer assignment, my role was to generate ideas and add features to our app. We mostly did our assignments equally, but Amaia Marquinez did more work.
